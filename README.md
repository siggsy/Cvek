# Cvek
Unofficial eAsistent open source android app

## About
Cvek is an unofficial open source eAsistent app aiming to bring better user experience to non premium users.
It does not include any trackers whatsoever, so bug submissions and contributions are always welcome.

## Future plans / TODOs
- [ ] Schedule with calendar for monthly overview
- [ ] Grade tracking
- [ ] Reported student absences
- [ ] Messsage overview (not as likely as it requires HTML scraping)

## UI mockup
Because app is still in development, actual screenshots do not exist.
Here are some pictures of UI mockups that roughly represent how an actual app will look like in the future.
